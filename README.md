# numbers
Create a bash script named “numbers.sh” that will prompt a user to type a positive integer and will then print all the numbers from 1 up to and including that number with the word "odd" or "even" on the same line as the number.
For example, if the user were to enter the number 5, the program would print
* 1 Odd
* 2 Even
* 3 Odd
* 4 Even
* 5 Odd
